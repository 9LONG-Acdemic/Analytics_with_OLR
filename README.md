Enhancing Compensation Prediction: An Ordinal Logistic Regression Approach in Data Science Survey Analysis

This is a repo of a course project from my data sciense graduate course, MIE1624, at University of Toronto.

## Project Description
This project aims to predict a survey respondentâ€™s current yearly compensation bucket, leveraging the pre-processed dataset from the "Kaggle ML & DS Survey Challenge" (2022). The project starts with data cleaning, addressing missing values, outliers, and normalization to ensure data quality. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) will follow, utilizing visualizations and statistical tests to uncover patterns and correlations in the compensation data. The choice of a customized ordinal classification model initiated from the ordered nature of compensation buckets. Considering the structured compensation-level hierarchy, this phase details the model's suitability over other types. To enhance the model's feasibility and accuracy, we implement strategies such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation. The project's culmination involves a comprehensive presentation of the results and insights. We analyze the factors influencing compensation, using visual aids and statistical summaries to illustrate findings and model improvements. The goal is to understand and show off the workflow of a data scientist.
